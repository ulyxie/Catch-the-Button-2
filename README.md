# Catch the button 2: electric boogaloo
## aka bootleg Osu

This game is a much better successor to Catch the Button 1. CTB1 was more of a prototype only having the basic game play. No sounds, no leaderboard.
CTB2 fixes that.

I won't lie. I am kinda proud of this actually. I had a blast while making this simple game because it's in a medium which is usually not used for game creation. Ah Winforms. Yes this is winforms.

Feel free to download it and compile it yourself. In the future I might add an executable for download but I don't know.
